#### General rules for posting

- üèõ We host here open **discussions to support our community**.
- #Ô∏è‚É£ Discussions are grouped up in different **categories**. Thus, choose the category that best represents your post.
- ‚ùî Post here **general questions**. Try to avoid reporting bugs and/or feature requests that are code specific;
  for this purpose, instead, rely on the issue tracking system of the relative repository (e.g. [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp),
  [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...).
- üëÄ Before raising a new question, please check whether your problem has already found a possible solution by
  [**searching among existing discussions**](../../../discussions).
- ‚öô Post on [**`icub-tech-support`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-tech-support) any request for robot maintenance
  (e.g. issues related to hardware and/or robot configuration files).

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com),
including instructions to run them.
